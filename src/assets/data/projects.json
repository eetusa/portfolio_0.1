I wanted to play around with it, and ended up with a quite pretty visual effect.<br><br>In ray casting 'rays' are sent outwards from a common point while detecting if a ray collides with anything. These collision points is the information that motivates the whole procedure. For example, in games collision detection can be done with ray casts: if a ray hits something and the distance to this hit point is of certain amount, it can mean a collision has happened or is about to happen. <br><br>I experimented with this, ending up with a nice shadow effect. I recommended checking out the demo and playing around with it! <br><br>The math heavy parts were inspired from different sources, such as <a target='_blank' href='http://geomalgorithms.com/'>Geometry Algorithms</a> and <a href='http://stackoverflow.com' target='_blank'>Stack OverFlow</a>.</p>",

        "readmore": "<h5>The costs of ray casting</h5><p>The key things when it comes to the cost of ray casting are the amount of rays and the amount of objects each ray checks itself against. The problem is that if your rays are cast at static angles, like one per degree, you might cast way more rays than necessary and the accuracy can be pretty bad. You can up the amount of rays to increase accuracy, but it can get expensive and the system still wouldn't be deterministic.<br><br> I solved this problem by casting rays at each corner of the polygons. Casting three rays per vertex - one directly at the corner and two slightly off - ensures you get a accurate hits on the edge of a polygon (from cast PoV) and accurate hits on objects behind the polygon. As the polygons can overlap, it's also important to find these intersections and treat them as vertices too.<br><br>Casting rays blindly at vertices isn't an end all cure all solution as when the amount of objects grows, the amount of rays grows while also the amount objects to check against per ray grows too. If this effect were to be used in a product it definitely could use some optimizing.</p>  <img alt='Casting rays at vertices and intersections' src='raycast/raycast_example.png'></img>",

Unity seemed to have problems with rendering high amounts of objects and also just in general having a high amount of objects. These problems probably could have been circumvented, but also probably with a cost. I'm currently transfering the system to Unreal Engine 5. Tools to build to cube world more effeciently and materials for cubes are the next step.<h5>Inner workings of the ground seeking algorithm</p></h5><p>The ground seeking algorithm recursively calls nearby cubes until a cube finds ground, and then flags the whole group as static. If no ground has been found and no more cubes are to be found, it means the build has lost support and it collapses. The algorithm has been optimized to see if a nearby group that it is connected to has ground contact, and also to prefer looking downwards, as that is where the ground usually is. It also has been written to call each cube only once, which would otherwise be a bit of an endless loop since it's a recursive algorithm.<br><br>What could be interesting to add to the algorithm are stress points. Currently a single cube can carry the weight of thousands, but adding a stress system could make the build collapse when too much of it weights on a weak point.</p><img alt='The algorithm prefers downwards' src='DestructibleWorld/algo.jpg'></img>",
