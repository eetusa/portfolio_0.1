I wanted to try it out, and ended up with a quite pretty visual effect.<br><br>In ray casting 'rays' are sent outwards from a common point while detecting if a ray collides with anything. These collision points is the information that motivates the whole procedure. For example in games collision detection can be done with ray casts: if a ray hits something and the distance to this hit point is of certain amount, it can mean a collision has happened or is about to happen. <br><br>I experimented with this information, ending up with a nice shadow effect. I recommended checking out the demo and playing around with it! <br><br>The math heavy parts were inspired from different sources, such as <a target='_blank' href='http://geomalgorithms.com/'>Geometry Algorithms</a> and <a href='http://stackoverflow.com' target='_blank'>Stack OverFlow</a>.</p>",

        "readmore": "<p>The key things when it comes to the cost of ray casting are the amount of rays and the amount of objects each ray checks itself against. The problem is that if your rays are cast at static angles, like one per degree, you might cast way more rays than necessary and the accuracy can be pretty bad. You can up the amount of rays to get more accurate, but it can get expensive and the system still wouldn't be deterministic.<br><br> I solved this problem by casting rays at each corner of the polygons. Casting three rays per vertex - one directly at the corner and two slightly off - ensures you get a accurate hits on the edge of a polygon (from cast PoV) and accurate hits on objects behind the polygon. As the polygons can overlap, it's also important to find these intersections and treat them as vertices too.<br><br>This isn't an end all cure all solution as when the amount of objects (vertices) grow the amount of rays grow while also the amount objects to check against per ray grows too. If this effect were to be used in a game, it definitely would need some optimizing.</p>  <img alt='Casting rays at vertices and intersections' src='raycast/raycast_example.png'></img>",

        "bodyEN":"<h5>A dynamic world out of cubes</h5><p>I wanted to develop a \"pseudo physics engine\" to create a destructible world. The idea is to use the built-in physics, but to use these physics in spesific ways. The world is built out of cubes that are initially static. When triggered in a certain way, they start following physics.<br><br>Implementing this for a single cube is quite simple, but handling everything in single cube cases means the world is fairly static. You can't, for example, destroy the base of a tower and expect the tower to collapse, as the cubes above the base have not been triggered. <br><br>What I implement is an algorithm, that works by proximity of other cubes, that determines if groups of cubes still have support. If they lose their support, they active in groups of varying sizes. That means that the world doesn't always break as single cubes, but also as large chunks.<br><br>I started the project in Unity, but I found it had problems scaling up. Unity seemed to have problems with rendering high amounts of objects and also just in general having a high amount of objects. I'm currently looking to transfering the system to Unreal Engine 5. My firsts tests indicate that the system scales a lot better in UE5.<br><br>After implementing the current system in Unreal, I'm planning on creating tools to built the world a bit more effeciently. Placing cubes one by one or by copy paste and then moving them isn't quite.. optimal. I'm also planning to add materials - maybe for weights and definitely for more interesting visuals.<br><br>I'm adding dev logs (in Finnish) to the videos section of this project. Even if you don't speak finnish, you can scroll around the video to see the system in action.</p>",

If no ground has been found and no more cubes are to be found, it means the build has lost support and it collapses. The algorithm has been optimized to see if a nearby group that it is connected to has ground contact, and also to prefer looking downwards, as that is where the ground usually is. It also has been written to call each cube only once, which would otherwise be a bit of an endless loop since it's a recursive algorithm.<br><br>What could be interesting to add to the algorithm are stress points. Currently a single cube can carry the weight of thousands, but adding a stress system could make the build collapse when too much of it weights on a weak point.</p><img alt='The algorithm prefers downwards' src='DestructibleWorld/algo.png'></img>",
