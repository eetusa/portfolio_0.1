My return to the field was taking programming studies while studying to be a classroom teacher at Rauma. That is when I found myself loving it. After rekindling the passion I've studied Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Currently I'm learning React and Bootstrap, both of which are used in this site. My clear strengths are self-learning, finding information, learning fast, applying learnt things in creative ways and always aiming for understanding rather than remembering. Most of my skills have been acquired by remote studying and self-learning."
